I designed a web application for managing all restaurant services.

-Organized frontend components into a modular structure (e.g., Menu, ReservationForm, OrderSummary) for
reusability and maintainability.
-Implemented server-side logic for handling CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization, following
RESTful API principles.
-Defined MongoDB schemas using Mongoose to structure and interact with restaurant data efficiently.
-Utilized middleware functions for request validation, error handling, and authentication checks on the
server-side.
-Proficiency in full-stack web development using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
